# DeathBattleGame_WithOOP
Implement some OOP principles from a procedural code

Requirements:
- When you run the program, user can enter the two character name.
- Once entered, the program will automatically let both character attack each other. Each attack will cause some health damage or none damage (if attack is avoided).
- Print all the attack, defence and health level.
- Attack damage is random. Normal attack damage is 1. Critical attack damage is 4.
- Defence (Avoid attack) is random. 
- The game will end when either one character has no more health.
